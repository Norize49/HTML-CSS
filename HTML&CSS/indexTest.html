<h2>Game process</h2>
<h3>General</h3>
<p>«The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt» he Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is an action role-playing game with a third-person perspective. Players control Geralt of Rivia, a monster slayer known as a Witcher.Geralt walks, runs, rolls and dodges, and (for the first time in the series) jumps, climbs and swims. He has a variety of weapons, including bombs, a crossbow and two swords (one steel and one silver).The steel sword is used primarily to kill humans while the silver sword is more effective against creatures and monsters. Players can draw out, switch and sheathe their swords at will. There are two modes of melee attack; light attacks are fast but weak, and heavy attacks are slow but strong.</p>
<p>The game has responsive, advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and dynamic environments. The day-night cycle influences some monsters; a werewolf becomes powerful during the night of a full moon. Players can learn about their enemies and prepare for combat by reading the in-game bestiary. When they kill an enemy, they can loot its corpse for valuables. Geralt's witcher sense enables players to find objects of interest, including items that can be collected or scavenged. Items are stored in the inventory, which can be expanded by purchasing upgrades.</p>
<p>In addition to physical attacks, Geralt has five magical signs at his disposal: <ins style="color:yellow ;">Aard, Axii, Igni, Yrden and Quen.</ins> Aard prompts Geralt to unleash a telekinetic blast, Axii confuses enemies, Igni burns them, Yrden slows them down and Quen offers players a temporary, protective shield. The signs use stamina, and cannot be used indefinitely. Players can use mutagens to increase Geralt's magic power. Geralt loses health when attacked by enemies, although wearing armour can help reduce health loss. Health is restored with meditation or consumables, such as food and potions. Players occasionally control Ciri, Geralt's adoptive daughter who can teleport short distances.</p>

<q>The screenshot of the gameplay. Geralt riding a horse rides along the island of Ard Skellig. In the corners of the screen you can see a mini-card, a health scale and the current task.</q>
<p>Players earn experience points by completing quests. When a player earns enough experience, Geralt's level increases and the player receives ability points. These points may be used on four skill trees: combat, signs, alchemy and general. Combat upgrades enhance Geralt's attacks and unlock new fighting techniques; signs upgrades enable him to use magic more efficiently, and alchemy upgrades improve crafting abilities. General upgrades have a variety of functions, from raising Geralt's vitality to increasing crossbow damage.[</p>
<h3>Narrative and additional activity</h3>
<p> <a id="C9"></a>The game focuses on narrative, and has a dialogue tree which allows players to choose how to respond to non-player characters. Geralt must make decisions which change the state of the world and lead to 36 possible endings, affecting the lives of in-game characters. He can have a romantic relationship with some of the game's female characters by completing certain quests. In addition to the main quests, books offer more information on the game's world. Players can begin side quests after visiting a town's noticeboard. These side missions include Witcher Contracts (elaborate missions requiring players to hunt monsters) and Treasure Hunt quests, which reward players with top-tier weapons or armour. The game's open world is divided into several regions. Geralt can explore each region on foot or by transportation, such as a boat. Roach, his horse, may be summoned at will. Players can kill enemies with their sword while riding Roach,[24] but an enemy presence may frighten the horse and unseat Geralt. Points of interest may be found on the map, and players receive experience points after completing mini-missions in these regions. Players can discover Places of Power for additional ability points.Other activities include horse racing, boxing and card playing; the card-playing mechanic was later expanded into a standalone game, Gwent: The Witcher Card Game.</p>

<img src="Andrzej.jpg" id="id" title="Andrzej" alt="Andrzej" align=left height="250" width="350">
<q id="jah">The author of the book series "Witcher" Andrzej Sapkowski at the Fair of Books in Prague in 2010.</q>
<p> <mark>«The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt» The player's choices can lead to several different endings. If Ciri survives after defeating the White Frost and Geralt took her to meet her father, she will become the Empress of Nilfgaard. If Ciri survives but did not meet the emperor, Geralt helps her fake her death, and she becomes a witcher. If Ciri is killed in her confrontation with the White Frost, the story ends with Geralt retrieving her medallion from the last remaining Crone. The player's choices also determine whether Geralt ends up in a romantic relationship with Yennefer, Triss, or neither, and how much of the North is ultimately conquered by Nilfgaard.</p>
<h3>Universe and characters</h3>
<p>The game takes place on the mainland - a fantasy world surrounded by parallel dimensions and immense universes, in which humans, elves, dwarves and many types of monsters live side by side, although nonhumans (representatives of any races other than human) regularly face persecution. At the time of the events of the game, the mainland is witnessing a large-scale war between Nilfgaard, a state in the south, led by Emperor Emhyr var Emreis, and Redania, a state in the north, ruled by King Radovid V. The protagonist visits during the game many places with different atmospheres: the wealthy cities of Novigrad and Oxenfurt; the devastated expanses of Velen's "no man's land" and the swamps in its south; the imperial residence in the capital of Temeria, Vizima; the Skellige archipelago, which has distinct features of the Viking states, and the witcher's fortress of Kaer Morhen.</p>
<p> The main character is Geralt of Rivia, a witcher, a monster hunter, endowed with extraordinary abilities, subjected to genetic mutations and undergoing intensive training since childhood. Geralt offers his services, relying on his ability in surveillance, combat and magic. He is assisted by two powerful sorceresses, his beloved Yennefer of Vengerberg and his girlfriend Triss Merigold, as well as the bard Buttercup, the dwarf Zoltan Chivay and his mentor, the old witcher Vesemir. A few years earlier, Geralt and Yennefer's adopted daughter, Ciri, the biological daughter of Emperor Emhyr var Emreis, disappeared while trying to escape the Wild Hunt, mysterious ghostly warriors from another dimension. Her reappearance stirred up the mainland.</p>
<h3><a id="C12"></a>Scenario</h3>
<p>
  After the events of the second part, a war rages between the Nilfgaardian Empire and what is left of the Northern Kingdoms. Geralt of Rivia learns that his missing adopted daughter Ciri was first seen after years of wandering between worlds; but she is reportedly haunted by the Wild Hunt (Polish: Dziki Gon), a mystical band of ghostly riders, a harbinger of war, disease, and the end of the world. Helping, among other allies, his friend Triss Merigold and his longtime lover Yennefer of Vengerberg, Geralt sets off in search of Ciri.
  The first leg of his journey begins in the war-torn village of White Orchard, where Geralt stops to meet Yennefer. Now she works for Emperor Nilfgaard and Ciri's biological father Emhyr var Emreis, who, through Yennefer, calls Geralt to Vizima (Polish Wyzima, English Vizima) to instruct him to find his daughter. She was last seen in the poor swampy area of ​​Velen (Polish and English Velen), in Vronitsy, the fortress of the Bloody Baron, the self-proclaimed lord of Velen and part-time imperial governor. The baron, embroiled in family problems, at first refuses to help Geralt, but an old acquaintance of the witcher, the sorceress Keira Metz, reports that someone else was in Velen, looking for Ciri, namely, an elven magician named Avallac'h, and now only the Mistress of the Forest , the witches that live in the Crooked Marsh will be able to tell Geralt more. The three witches say that they kept Ciri in custody to deliver her to the Wild Hunt, but the girl managed to escape. With this discovery, the witcher returns to the baron and informs about his missing wife Anna, who now serves the Mistresses; in response, the baron tells that Ciri, with whom he became friends, went to Novigrad (Polish Novigrad), a large port city, which is the largest city in the world.
